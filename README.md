## ðŸš€ Projects:
- **AI-Driven Crop Disease Prediction and Management System**  
  *Developed as part of a hackathon challenge, this system uses machine learning algorithms to predict and manage crop diseases based on image data, helping farmers to optimize yield and minimize losses.*

- **Audio-to-Text Video Highlights App**  
  *Built an app that extracts audio from video, converts it to text using OpenAI Whisper, and highlights important segments based on text analysis. The identified sections are then cut into 30-second video reels.*

- **Parkinson's Disease Prediction Model**  
  *Created a machine learning model for predicting Parkinson's disease, utilizing patient data to identify early warning signs of the condition.*
